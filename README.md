### Introduction
- A python administered project which uses Huffman Encoding Technique to compress a text file into a binary file.
- Utilizes Linear Block Codes to identify any errors committed while compression.

### What is Huffman Coding?

- The algorithm was developed by David A. Huffman in the late 19th century as part of his research into computer programming and is commonly found in programming languages such as C, C + +, Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and more.

- Huffman Coding is a way to compress and encode text, based on the frequency of the characters in that text.

- In computer science and information theory, Huffman code is a special kind of optimal prefix code that is often used for lossless data compression.


### Theory Behind Huffman Coding

- The thought process behind Huffman encoding is that a letter or a symbol which occurs frequently is represented by a shorter code, and the one that appears rarely is represented by a longer code. This leads to an efficient representation of characters that require less memory to be stored.

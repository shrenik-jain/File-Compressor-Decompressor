### Introduction
- A python administered project which uses Huffman Encoding Technique to compress a text file into a binary file.
- Utilizes Linear Block Codes to identify any errors committed while compression.

### What is Huffman Coding?

- The algorithm was developed by David A. Huffman in the late 19th century as part of his research and is commonly found in programming languages such as C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and more.

- Huffman Coding is a way to compress and encode text, based on the frequency of the characters in that text.

- It is an optimal prefix coding technique used for lossless data compression.

- The Huffman encoding for a typical text file saves about 40% of the size of the original data.

### Theory Behind Huffman Coding

- The thought process behind Huffman encoding is that a letter or a symbol which occurs frequently is represented by a shorter code, and the one that appears rarely is represented by a longer code. This leads to an efficient representation of characters that require less memory to be stored.

- To compress a sequence of characters, we need a table that gives us the sequences of bits used for each character. This table creates an encoding tree that uses the root/leaf path to create a bit sequence to encodes the characters. Using this we can create a list of all characters with the maximum bit length of the encoded characters and the number of occurrences.

- To construct an optimal tree, we use a greedy algorithm. Huffman encoding trees return the minimum length character encodings used in data compression. The nodes in the tree represent the frequency of a characterâ€™s occurrence. The root node represents the length of the string, and traversing the tree gives us the character-specific encodings. Once the tree is constructed, traversing the tree gives us the respective codes for each symbol.

### Linear Block Codes

- In coding theory, a linear code is an error-correcting code for which any linear combination of codewords is also a codeword. Linear codes are traditionally partitioned into block codes and convolutional codes, although turbo codes can be seen as a hybrid of these two types. Linear codes allow for more efficient encoding and decoding algorithms than other codes.

- Linear codes are used in forward error correction and are applied in methods for transmitting symbols (e.g., bits) on a communications channel so that, if errors occur in the communication, some errors can be corrected or detected by the recipient of a message block. The codewords in a linear block code are blocks of symbols that are encoded using more symbols than the original value to be sent.

- A linear code of length n transmits blocks containing n symbols. For example, the [7,4] Hamming code is a linear binary code which represents 4-bit messages using 7-bit codewords. Two distinct codewords differ in at least three bits. As a consequence, the error detecting ability is 2 bits per codeword while the error correcting ability is 1.

### Decompression

- For the final and easiest step, we use a hashmap data structure. 

- We loop through the binary file and keep adding the binary digits to an empty string, curr_code until it matches with one of the codewords whose corresponding symbol added to the decoded text.

- As soon as we add the decoded character or symbol to the decode string, the curr_codestring is again made empty and the same process is repeated.

### Usage

- Run decompress.py
- All you have to do is enter the string to be encoded and let us do the rest!
